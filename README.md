# Skipify üéµ

**Skipify** is a lightweight Chrome extension that lets you set a custom time (in seconds) for when Spotify Web Player should automatically skip to the next track.


## üß† Why I Built This

I wanted to automate skipping at a set time without touching the player every time. Also a good way to work with Chrome extensions, web scripting, and real use-case behavior automation.

Main inspiration is from Ed Sheeran's "Give Me Love, I love that song but the duration is a whopping 8:46 for absolutely no reason (2nd part wasn't needed)

I always wanted to just cut off and go next... So shout out Mr Ed Sheeran.
